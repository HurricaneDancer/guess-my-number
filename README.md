<h1>Guess My Number</h1>

<p>
Guess my number is a game which is part of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>'s JavaScript course on Udemy. This is my implementation of the game (I did this before looking at the solution or following his tutorial)

In this game, you must guess the secret number that has been generated (Don't cheat with the console üò°)</br>
If you guess too low or too high, the game will tell you.</br>
If you win, the screen will change to green and the message will update.</br>
If you lose, the screen will change to red and the message will update.</br>
You can reset the game by clicking "Again!" and it will update your scores and the screen.</br>

The point of this lesson was DOM manipulation </br>
